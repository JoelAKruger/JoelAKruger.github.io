# About Me
I am studying Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering at Monash University. My main interests are low-level systems programming, operating systems and computer architecture and performance optimisation. I am interested in how operating systems and applications interact with hardware, and enjoy the challenges of systems programming and optimisation.

# Projects
## 3D Game with Custom Engine Written in C++ (in progress)
Strategy / Tower Defense game with multiplayer written for Windows and DirectX 11.
Randomly generated map.

## AI Aim Assist
Uses a custom trained Yolov8 model along with an arduino microcontroller to help the player aim at an enemy. This required a lot of optimisation to run in real time with low latency, such as doing image processing with DirectX and writing the program in C++ instead of Python.
